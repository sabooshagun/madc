        <h2>About the Package</h2>
        <p>Like the cryptocurrency market develops in prominence, so does the urge to keep a close eye on price patterns in order to make prudent financial decisions. The general public's awareness and sources in this market are currently limited. We find a way to put all of the pricing patterns and whereabouts of crypto to this specific place, making it more accessible to developers working on related products as well as ordinary retail investors aiming to make superior data-backed investment strategies.
            Taking the above in perspective, we have created a Python package which will use API requests to gather information for all crypto currencies, to visualize and then analyse and anticipate price trends. To retrieve specific stories regarding the input currency, we'll mainly employ web scraping and natural language processing.
